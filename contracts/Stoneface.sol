/* ROOTKIT:
Stoneface will protect you
Stoneface will hold stuff
Like KETH
But it doesn't know anything
So it can't call setFloorCalculator
Or setSweeper
Or anything, really
It's pretty stupid
But it'll give stuff back if we want
And if we're patient enough
Cus it takes a while
Unless we tell it to watch the distribution
Then he wont give it back at all
Unless the distribution is complete
Stoneface is slow
